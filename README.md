Using three datasets that are available on the city of Chicago's Data Portal:

    (1) CENSUS_DATA: https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/05c3415cbfbtfnr2fx4atenb2sd361ze.csv
    (2) CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/f9gjvj1gjmxxzycdhplzt01qtz0s7ew7.csv
    (3) CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA: https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/svflyugsr9zbqy5bmowgswqemfpm1x7f.csv
    
Loading data from the above sources, create tables and then use SQL to answer the questions on this datasets.
